## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to use a .svg as a background image. Learned how viewport and viewbox work (didn't use, but I'm sure it will be very useful to my future projects)

### Continued development

For future projects I want to make my front end works totally functional with a bit of JavaScript and more.

### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://convertingcolors.com/) - Particullarly I like to call the colors on my CSS code by its HEX code (not always the best choice though). This website converts the code for you from any format you have to any format you like. By now, it is my favorite.
